					<h2>The Action <strong>Plan</strong></h2>
					<p>We recommend taking a picture from each side of a room across showing corner to corner. If, it requires more than one picture, please take as many as needed. These pictures should show all personal property in the room. Take as many pictures as are necessary to document the condition of an item. You must list every item in the room stating the name, manufacturer, age and condition of the item.</p>
